This class fosters the familiarity and interest of English by immersing children in a full preschool day with native English speaking teachers and friends.
Along with a monthly theme, children will sing songs, dance, go for walks, play games, read books and make crafts.
We provide a total English environment identical to a typical preschool class in English-speaking countries.
Children are curious about everything and often ask parents questions that leave them dumbfounded, like “Why do we have eyebrows?” or “Why do dogs sniff everything?” 
Knowing how things work help children make sense of the world around them.
Imagine your child rushing through the door after school, all aglow because she got praised by her teacher for being able to correctly answer something that was not in any of her textbooks.
This is one of the most pleasing advantages; to expose your child to a good amount of general knowledge. After all, there is nothing better than a happy and confident child!</br>
